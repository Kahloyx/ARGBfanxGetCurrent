# ARGBfanxGetCurrent
Controlling an argb pc fan and controlling the tension and current delivered to this one w/ INA219


I use an Arduino nano to control an INA219 and an argb fan and I switch on/off/cycles of the argb ring onto the fan via a shell script from a linux computer on the /dev/ttyUSB0 serial connection.
Quite simple innit ?
