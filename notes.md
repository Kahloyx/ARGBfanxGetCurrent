	I need to make a little adjusments for switching on and off, as I did for switching light cycle

	I just implemented serial communication to arduino, s to switch, n to on, f to off.

	I removed the part in which one we used to read an analog input to check if there was any changement and then switch throught led cycles. All works fine with serial rn.

	I just forgotted to write it down but I made some simple commands just to be sure that the terminal was working fine and quickly, so we got 'n' for on, 'f' for off, and 's' to change the leds cycle, for the moment there's only two which are my blue and pink aesthethicc, and a set color string going on and on, there's only two modes due to my lack of inspiration but all is ready to just make a new one and then increase the numbers of cycles in the beginning of the sketch.

	I think Imma search for a cycle with some pink/purple red/orange/yellow cycle, maybe 3 or 4 main colors to build a theme around my desk, Just hope that I'll find some decent premade HUEs to work with, otherwise I will make some customs ones.
